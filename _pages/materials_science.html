During my Ph.D. studies, I also have experience employing density functional theory (DFT) 
simulations on electronic materials systems. Unlike the theoretical nature of
my quantum chemistry research projects, this work is more application-driven, with the goal
to identify ideal compounds for novel electronic materials platforms.
Indeed, inorganic crystals are quite different from molecular systems 
("<strong>more is different</strong>"), owing to the periodic boundary conditions.

<h2>Adaptive Optimization for Materials Design</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify">

I developed an adaptive optimization engine for electronic materials design.

<p style="text-align: justify">
The optimization scheme starts from an initial set of design of experiments, 
where system variables, design objectives, 
and design space are first defined for the problem.
<strong>Property evaluation</strong>: The target material properties (design objectives) 
are evaluated either by experimental measurement or theoretical simulations. 
Candidate composition and its evaluated properties are then added to a <strong>Data repository</strong>, 
which initially may either be empty or only contains entries 
for existing materials within the design space. 
Its size grows as more candidate materials are evaluated during the adaptive optimization process.

<p style="text-align: justify">
<strong>Featureless learning</strong> involves directly learning from the chemical composition 
of materials comprising the data repository by mapping each compositional variable 
into a two-dimensional latent space (spanned by z1 and z2) using maximum likelihood estimation, 
which enables the construction of a latent variable Gaussian process (LVGP) surrogate model. 
knowledge within the data repository. 
<strong>Composition optimization</strong>: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization 
is then performed with the LVGP models to obtain the next candidate material composition 
with the highest expected maximin improvement.
The iterative optimization continues until all compounds satisfying the objectives are discovered, 
forming the Pareto front, or research resources expire.

<h2>Materials Informatics</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Keeping the numerical optimization methods and their limitations in mind,
I realized the significance of statistical learning for us to further understand
materials physics.
To that end, I made some statistical analysis on crystal structure databases using 
a deep neural network.
We used structure factors in the form of 3D point cloud to uniquely represent
crystal structures and chemical compositions, and analyzed the correlation between
symmetry, electron density, and materials properties.

Lastly, I explore the potential of using symbolic learning to reveal some governing physical
laws from a large amount of data.
