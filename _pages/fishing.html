<h3>Why fishing, why here</h3>

You might be wondering, why would I put this seemingly 
irrelevant topic on a professional website?
This is a good question.
The fact is, I love fishing, just like I enjoy my
research. Indeed, I find fishing very similar to
scientific research in many ways.
To that end, I would like to share some of my fishing experience
with you, in case you find it appealing as well.

Right: "The Crab and the Sea" I keep wondering what Mr. Crab 
has been thinking..

Fail a lot, empty-handed
Finally things will work out
