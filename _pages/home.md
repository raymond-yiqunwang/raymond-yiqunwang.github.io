Aloha! I am Raymond Wang, currently a Research Scientist at ByteDance AI Lab.
Thank you for visiting my website! I look forward to getting to know you if you find my
research and background interesting.


I received my Ph.D. in Chemistry from Northwestern University in 2021. I was supervised by 
[Dr. James Rondinelli](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/rondinelli-james.html), 
[Dr. Kenneth Poeppelmeire](https://chemistry.northwestern.edu/people/core-faculty/profiles/kenneth-poeppelmeier.html),
and [Dr. Toru Shiozaki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/torushiozaki/).
My journey as a computational chemist started in 2014 when I bought my first MacBook and started learning programming. 
I was fascinated by theoretical modelling and computational simulation of quantum molecular systems, 
thanks to proper guidance from [Dr. Zhipan Liu](https://zpliu.fudan.edu.cn/) at Fudan University 
and [Dr. Anastassia Alexandrova](https://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/directory/alexandrova-anastassia-n) at UCLA.


I am particularly interested in interdisciplinary research interfacing 
quantum chemistry, materials science, optimization theory, as well as machine learning.
Please see below for an overview of my research experience.


## Quantum Chemistry

In a nutshell, as a theoretical chemisty, I develop novel algorithms 
to efficiently solve the time-independent Schrodinger equation.

I build quantitative numerical/statistical models to simulate and understand complex chemical and biological systems. 
My doctoral research was focused on computational chemistry and cheminformatics, 
where I developed post-Hartree-Fock models to accurately solve the Schrodinger euqation for quantum molecular systems.
computational models to simulate chemical systems and build statistical models (i.e., machine learning models) to predict relevant properties of chemical systems. The research was mainly focused on organic chemical systems as well as inorganic materials domain, with the ultimate goal to accelerate the discovery of novel
chemicals (e.g., drug molecules, photovoltaic materials, electronic materials, etc.)0
My current research focus is on modelling organic molecules (e.g., drug molecules), large biological molecules (e.g., proteins and antibodies), and their interaction mechanisms (fundamental scientific research). The ultimate goal is to accelerate the process of drug discovery. I applied my previous research skills, e.g., computational simulation, statistical modelling, etc., to fulfill my current job duties.
