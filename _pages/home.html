    Aloha! I am Raymond Wang, nice to e-meet you &#x1F33A;.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
    Thank you for journeying through my digital abode. 
    I built this website not just as a platform to share my research, 
    but also as a bridge to connect with wonderful individuals, much like yourself, from around the globe.
    Dive in, and you'll uncover the passion that fuels my research and perhaps, 
    pick up a thing or two about the subjects that fascinate me &#x1F9EC; &#x1F9EA; &#x1F916;. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
    I received my Ph.D. in Computational Chemistry from Northwestern University in 2021. 
    I was supervised by 
    <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/rondinelli-james.html">Dr. James Rondinelli</a>
    and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/torushiozaki/">Dr. Toru Shiozaki</a>.
    My journey as a computational chemist started in 2014 when I bought my first MacBook and started programming. 
    I was fascinated by theoretical modelling and computational simulation of quantum molecular systems, 
    thanks to guidance from 
    <a href="https://zpliu.fudan.edu.cn/">Dr. Zhipan Liu</a> at Fudan University and
    <a href="https://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/directory/alexandrova-anastassia-n">Dr. Anastassia Alexandrova</a> at UCLA.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
    I have a keen interest in research that bridges the domains of 
    <a href="/drug_discovery/">AI-accelerated drug discovery</a>, 
    <a href="/materials_design/">electronic materials design</a>, 
    and <a href="/quantum_chemistry/">quantum chemistry</a>. 
    Please feel free to nagivate into the topics that most resonate with your interests.

    Yet my passions aren't just confined to the academic realm. 
    Beyond the world of scientific research, I find solace in the gentle sway of fishing rods &#x1F3A3;
    and the miraculous sprout of plants in my home garden &#x1F331;.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
    Enjoy your stay, and should you wish to strike a conversation, don't hesitate to reach out. 
    Let's cultivate some cool ideas and maybe even exchange fishing tales or gardening tips!
