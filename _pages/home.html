Aloha! I am Raymond Wang, currently a Research Scientist at ByteDance AI Lab.
Thank you for visiting my website! 
If you find my research or background interesting,
please do not hesitate to connect with me.
I look forward to getting to know you and sharing some exciting research.

<br><br>

I received my Ph.D. in Chemistry from Northwestern University in 2021. 
I was supervised by 
<a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/rondinelli-james.html">Dr. James Rondinelli</a>,
<a href="https://chemistry.northwestern.edu/people/core-faculty/profiles/kenneth-poeppelmeier.html">Dr. Kenneth Peoppelmeire</a>,
and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/torushiozaki/">Dr. Toru Shiozaki</a>.
My journey as a computational chemist started in 2014 when I bought my first MacBook and started learning programming. 
I was fascinated by theoretical modelling and computational simulation of quantum molecular systems, 
thanks to proper guidance from 
<a href="https://zpliu.fudan.edu.cn/">Dr. Zhipan Liu</a> at Fudan University and
<a href="https://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/directory/alexandrova-anastassia-n">Dr. Anastassia Alexandrova</a> at UCLA.

<br><br>

I am particularly interested in interdisciplinary research interfacing 
drug discovery, quantum chemistry, materials science, 
optimization theory, as well as machine learning.
Please see below for an overview of my research topics.

<h2>AI-Accelerated Drug Design & Discovery</h2>

I joined ByteDance in 07/2021 as a research scientist to focus on decoding
the structure-activity relationship for biomolecular systems, 
e.g., enzymes, drug molecules, peptides, etc.
With my previous research experience in quantum chemistry and materials physics, 
my goal is to develop fundamental theoretical framework for data-driven methods
(i.e., AI models), which could be applied to solve existing challenges.
I belive that physics-guided statistical models will become a significant complimentary 
method to the well-developed analytical/numerical solvers.
The detailed research advances will be shared with the research community 
once we make significant breakthroughs.

<h2>Quantum Chemistry</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify">
In a nutshell, as a theoretical chemist, 
I develop quantitative numerical models to simulate and understand
quantum molecular systems by solving the
time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation.
My research was mainly focused on developing active space decomposition (ASD) algorithm 
with second-order orbital optimization,
and Douglas-Kroll-Hess (DKH) scalar relativistic approximation method.
I contributed to the open-source quantum chemistry simulation package
<a href="https://github.com/qsimulate-open/bagel">BAGEL</a>, currently maintained by Dr. Toru Shiozaki
and his deep tech startup <a href="https://qsimulate.com/">QSimulate</a>.
I find the complex theoretical framework and computational modelling techniques 
extremely exciting, which was the main driving force for me to attend Northwestern
for graduate studies.

<h2>Materials Science & Engineering</h2>

</font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
During my Ph.D. studies, I developed a data-driven materials design framework by threading 
multiple research subdomains, i.e., first principles density functional theory (DFT) simulations, 
materials informatics, and optimization theory.
Electronic materials research is intimately connected to condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry,
with more focus on inorganic crystals with periodic boundary conditions.
The materials systems under investigation have high degrees of freedom in terms of
chemical compositions, microscopic lattice structures, as well as electronic/magnetic interactions.
I start to realize that we may never have a universal solver to achieve 
"one model to solve them all". Therefore, interdisciplinary research is worth more 
attention owing to its power in bringing scientists and engineers with various backgrounds 
together to solve existing challenges.
I enjoy learning new concepts and research methodologies from other domain experts.
