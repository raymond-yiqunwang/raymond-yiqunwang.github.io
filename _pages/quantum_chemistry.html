<h2>Introduction to The Wave Function Approach</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify">


Our main objective is to solve the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation (<strong>Figure 1a</strong>),
from which we could determine physical properties of a molecule, in theory.
Computationally solving this equation comprises constructing the Hamiltonian operator 
and formulating the wave functions.
Numerically speaking, we employ an eigen-solver (<strong>Figure 1b</strong>) to approximately diagonalize 
a huge Hermitian matrix (the Hamiltonian) within a subspace of the entire Hilbert space 
to obtain the ground state wave function (based on the linear variational method).

However, the time complexity of this step grows exponentially w.r.t. the system size,
which makes simulating large molecules (e.g., proteins) 
at quantum mechanical level extremely challenging.
Therefore, theoretical chemists develop novel methods to 
find a balance between "accuracy" and "efficiency".
In other words, we would like to simulate a quantum molecular system
as accurately as possible, with an affordable computational cost.

<h2>Active Space Decomposition</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify">

The main idea of Active Space Decomposition (ASD) algorithm is about 
"<strong>divide and conquer</strong>". 
Specifically, we virtually divide the entire molecule into
several fragments, i.e., functional groups (<strong>Figure 1c</strong>).
Then, within each molecular fragment, we optimize for the most significant
electronic configurations to properly represent the state of the fragment.
The way we determine the importance of configurations is similar in nature
to that in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm.
For small molecules, we could take all electronic configurations into consideration,
and reconstruct the exact total wave function without loss of information.
For larger systems, we discard the less significant configurations of each fragment,
and combine the most informative states from all fragments to reconstruct the
molecular electronic wave function.
This way, we can control how much information we want to keep, 
hence achieving a balance between "accuracy" and "efficiency".

<br><br>

To further optimize for the ground state electronic structures, I also employed
second-order orbital optimization on top of the ASD algorithm (<strong>Figure 1d</strong>).
In a nutshell, this step is about iteratively 
solving the eigen-decomposition problem within the current subspace
and optimizing for a better subspace in which the ground truth lies.

<h2>Douglas-Kroll-Hess Scalar Relativistic Approximation</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify">

I am also interested in considering relativistic effects for quantum molecular systems.
Relativistic effects are particularly important for molecules containing
transition-metal ions, e.g., Cu, Fe, which are essential elements in human body.

<p style="text-align: justify">

I developed scalar relativistic models based on Douglas-Kroll-Hess algorithm.
Compared with non-relativistic models, our formulation is slightly more complicated
and requires higher numerical accuracy.
The theoretical details is out of the scope of this post, but I am happy to discuss
if you are interested.
I personally find making derivations and implementing these models extremely exciting,
especially when the first time my model works.  :)
