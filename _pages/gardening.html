<h2>Why fishing, why here</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify">
You might be wondering, why would I put this seemingly 
irrelevant topic on a professional website?
This is a good question.
The fact is, I love fishing, just like I enjoy scientific research. 
Indeed, I find fishing quite similar in nature to
doing research in many aspects.
To that end, I would like to share some of my fishing experience
with you, in case you find it appealing as well.
</p>

<h2>Empty your mind</h2>

You will probably spend 99% of time waiting before a successful catch.
What would you do during that time?
In fact, fishing is a great way for me to interact with mother nature.
While keeping an eye on my rod, I pretty much think about nothing else, 
just feel the wind, the sunshine, and the horizon..
</p>

<h2>Be patient</h2>

Just like doing scientific research, typically you are the only one 
knowing what exactly you are doing/up to.
Others might have doubts on you - "Can this guy really catch anything?".
Well, fishermen spend most of the time waiting for the next catch,
so it seems we are not really doing anything at all.
Isn't doing research exactly the same?

<br><br>

One of the greatest lessons I learned from fishing, 
is to remain optimistic, and be patient.
Good things will happen, when the time comes.
Everybody knows this in theory, but fishing is a very practical way
to fully understand it..

<br><br>

<strong> P.S. I follow the catch & release protocol to protect the environment 
and ecosystem sustainability</strong>, 
except for invasive species such as round goby and red-eared slider.

<h2>You never know</h2>

After casting out your bait, <strong>you never know what comes next</strong>.
Sometimes you aim for a carp, but eventually get a catfish (very likely going to happen).
Just like scientific research, you have some sense of your destination,
but might end up at a very different place.
To me personally, the semi-deterministic process with stochastic perturbations is quite charming.
</p>

<h2>Be professional</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify">

I take fishing seriously, and I quickly realized this is a challenging sport.
The rewarding mechanism of fishing is quite interesting - before figuring out the
correct approach, you may always receive negative feedback.
In order to succeed, one must find the right spot (find the structure), 
use the right lure/bait (know the diet of different species),
be at the right time (at dawn or sunset), <i>for each species</i>..
And of course, you also need to be lucky enough.

<br><br>

To give you a concrete example, I used to find it hard to specifically target common carps 
in Chicago river since catfish and carp share some common diet. I learned from some
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Catsandcarp">YouTubers</a> 
to use <a href="https://bestofangling.com/what-is-a-method-feeder/">method feeders</a>.
With the professional equipments, I successfully landed many nice carps (PB 9.1lb).

<strong>Feel free to reach out to me for further discussions
if you find it interesting. 
I'm happy to share more and learn from you as well!</strong>
