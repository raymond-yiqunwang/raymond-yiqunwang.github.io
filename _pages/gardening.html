    Welcome to my sanctuary of growth and greenery. 
    In this gallery, you'll journey through the life stages of some of my favorite plants, 
    nurtured right from their seed form. From the humble beginnings of a tiny seed, 
    to the moment they break through the soil, reaching out to the sky, 
    every stage is a testament to the wonders of life.

    Let the story of my plants unfold in these images.

<h2>Seedling</h2>

The journey of each plant in my garden begins here, resting as a seed, poised and waiting to germinate. 
There's an unparalleled joy in planting a seed and watching it burst forth into its first tender green shoot. 
Nurturing these fledglings, witnessing their earliest days, and knowing they are the result of a small seed and attentive care is profoundly rewarding. 


<h2>Growth</h2>

Summer is a symphony of growth in my garden. 
As the sun generously showers its warmth, each plant responds with an enthusiastic surge, 
reaching upwards, spreading outwards, and flourishing in its own unique rhythm. 
The once tender seedlings now showcase their strength and character, basking in the season's vibrancy. 

<h2>Harvesting</h2>
