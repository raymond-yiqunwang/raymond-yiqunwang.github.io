<h3>Decoding Intermolecular Interactions from a Data-driven Perspective</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify">

In our lab, researchers with various education background (e.g., AI, chemistry, biology)
work collaboratively on the most challenging biological problems.
Our goal is to develop novel AI models to understand biomolecular systems and 
reveal the governing physical laws from a data-driven perspective.

<br><br>

Specifically, I am interested in teaching AI models to think
like a theoretical chemist (<strong>Figure 1</strong>).
Instead of purely making inference from data, I try to enforce the model to
learn physical rules (e.g., symmetry constraints) by hard-coding them into the
model architecture. I apologize for not being able to introduce too many details here
at this stage. However, I would be happy to have individual discussions to share
some ideas and explore potential collaborations. In addition, our team will share
our research advances with the community once we make significant breakthroughs.
Cheers.
