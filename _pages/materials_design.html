<p style="text-align: justify">
    During my Ph.D. studies, I developed a data-driven framework for electronic materials design 
    by weaving together several research subdomains: first principles density functional theory (DFT) simulations, 
    materials informatics, and optimization theory. 
    The intricacies of electronic materials, deeply rooted in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry, 
    often revolve around inorganic crystals with periodic boundary conditions.
    The complexity of materials systems helps me realize the immense value of interdisciplinary research, 
    whose strength lies in uniting scientists and engineers from diverse backgrounds, 
    fostering collaboration to address prevailing challenges.

<h2>Adaptive Optimization for Materials Design</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify">
    This general workflow helps materails scientists effectively identify 
    candidate compounds exhibiting superior functionality by design.
    The optimization scheme starts from an initial set of design of experiments, 
    where system variables, design objectives, 
    and design space are first defined for the problem.
    <strong>Property evaluation</strong>: The target material properties (i.e., design objectives) 
    are evaluated either by experimental measurement or theoretical simulations. 
    Candidate composition and its evaluated properties are then added to a <strong>Data repository</strong>, 
    which initially may either be empty or only contain entries 
    for existing materials within the design space. 
    Its size grows as more candidate materials are evaluated during the adaptive optimization process.

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
    <strong>Featureless learning</strong> involves directly learning from the chemical composition 
    of materials comprising the data repository by mapping each compositional variable 
    into a two-dimensional latent space using maximum likelihood estimation, 
    which enables the construction of a latent variable Gaussian process (LVGP) surrogate model. 
    <strong>Composition optimization</strong>: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization 
    is then performed with the LVGP models to obtain the next candidate material composition 
    with the highest expected maximin improvement.
    The iterative optimization continues until all compounds satisfying the objectives are discovered, 
    forming the Pareto front, or research resources are exhausted.

<h2>Materials Informatics</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify">
    When we talk about materials "structure-property relationship", a more precise description
    ought to be "structure-composition-property relationship", since the 3D arrangement of atoms 
    as well as their atomic species co-determine materials properties.
    One would naturally ask: how does structure alone impact materials properties?
    The answer to this question helps us optimize materials functionality through perturbing
    their atomic structures (e.g., applying pressure).
    <br><br>
    Machine learning offers a unique perspective to this question.
    By marginalizing chemical composition information in crystalline materials and perform 
    statistical analysis via a trained deep neural network, we study the response of various
    materials properties to crystal structures without chemical compositions.
    Our secret sauce is that X-ray diffraction patterns preserve 3D structure information,
    while discarding partial compositional information (due to the infamous phase problem).
    We train a deep neural network to learn from the diffraction patterns for multiple materials 
    property classificaitons, and analyze how different structures influence these properties.
    We find that crystal symmetry is more important than the diffraction intensities contained within 
    for the model to make a successful classification. 
    <br><br>
    Our work also showcases the potential of using machine learning models to help understand materials physics, 
    rather than performing predictive or generative tasks as in most materials informatics research. 
    We also argue that learning the crystal structure genome in a chemistry-agnostic manner demonstrates that 
    some crystal structures inherently host high propensities for optimal materials properties, 
    which enables the decoupling of structure and composition for future codesign of multifunctionality.

    One of my most influential work explores the potential of using symbolic learning 
    to reveal some governing physical laws from a large amount of data.
    Symbolic regression has recently garnered much attention from the scientific research
    community owing to its form-free learning mechanism,
    which makes it an ideal tool for materials scientists to analyze their experimental data.
    See <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mrs-communications/article/abs/symbolic-regression-in-materials-science/A5836F4AF5E9395A9B27541C5042A7F3">here</a> for more details.

    I also have experience employing density functional theory (DFT) 
    simulations on electronic materials systems. Unlike the theoretical nature of
    my quantum chemistry research projects, this work is more application-driven
    and involves more simulation-running tasks, whose goal is 
    to identify ideal compounds for novel electronic materials platforms.
    Indeed, inorganic crystals are quite different from molecular systems 
    (<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.177.4047.393"><strong>more is different</strong></a>).
    There is so much that I would like to talk about regarding this topic 
    (e.g., its relationship with the "scaling law" in AI research).
    Don't hesitate to reach out for some further discussions!
